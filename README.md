# LIDC-IDRI-Image-Anomaly-Detection
This repository would preprocess, segment and extract features from the LIDC-IDRI dataset to create a machine learning algorithm able to determine if a lung image is "normal" or anomalous. This is done by applying a gabor filter to enhance the image, then a watershed segmentation which will be helpful during feature extraction.
